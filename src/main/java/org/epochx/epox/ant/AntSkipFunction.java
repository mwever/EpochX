 * function, this node may operate as
 * either a function or a terminal depending on how the ant is provided. It may
 * optionally be provided at construction, in which case it becomes a terminal
 * which operates on its internal ant. Alternatively, it can require one child
 * node with a data-type of Ant. In this case, when evaluated it will first
 * evaluate its child to obtain its ant.
